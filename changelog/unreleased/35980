Enhancement: Cleanup encryption config values on disabling encryption

occ encryption:disable command was changed to delete some encryption-specific
config key-value pairs that made reenabling encryption not possible.
Also a safety check was added to prevent disabling encrypion until all files are
decrypted. And finally occ encryption:disable command was granted with an exit code.
